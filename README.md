#  Rover Farm Field Simulation

This project simulates an autonomous rover navigating a rectangular farm field using a **zigzag (lawnmower) path**, avoiding obstacles, and covering the entire field area from a starting point to an endpoint.

The simulation is animated using `matplotlib` in Python, and the rover’s movement and trail are visually shown on a grid that represents the farm field.

---

##  What It Does:

- Models a 2D farm field using a grid.
- Simulates a rover starting from a defined point.
- Moves in a **zigzag/lawnmower pattern** to ensure **full area coverage**.
- Avoids static obstacles placed on the field.
- Animates the rover’s real-time path using `matplotlib`.
- Marks visited, unvisited, and obstacle cells with different colors.
- Option to adjust grid size, obstacles, speed, and path strategy.
